# The Data
I have chosen to explore the weather data for the Chicago airport. This dataset includes information from July 2014 to June 2015, with the following columns:

Column | Description
---|---------
`date` | The date of the weather record, formatted YYYY-M-D
`actual_mean_temp` | The measured average temperature for that day
`actual_min_temp` | The measured minimum temperature for that day
`actual_max_temp` | The measured maximum temperature for that day
`average_min_temp` | The average minimum temperature on that day since 1880
`average_max_temp` | The average maximum temperature on that day since 1880
`record_min_temp` | The lowest ever temperature on that day since 1880
`record_max_temp` | The highest ever temperature on that day since 1880
`record_min_temp_year` | The year that the lowest ever temperature occurred
`record_max_temp_year` | The year that the highest ever temperature occurred
`actual_precipitation` | The measured amount of rain or snow for that day
`average_precipitation` | The average amount of rain or snow on that day since 1880
`record_precipitation` | The highest amount of rain or snow on that day since 1880

This data was already quite clean, so no additional cleaning steps were taken up front. Details about plot implementation can be found in the code. 

### Plots 1 and 2: Precipitation by Month
Plot 1 graphs days with precipitation by month.

Plot 2 graphs percentage of days with precipitation by month.

In general, Chicago gets more precipitation in the winter than in the summer. 

### Plot 3: Heatmap of Maximum Daily Temperature 
This plot visualizes the change in maximum daily temperature over the year, with darker red representing hotter days. Note that there are two plots that are half full. This is because we only have data for half of the year for two years.

It is much hotter in the summer than in the winter in Chicago. The weather in the winter is often below freezing, which implies that the precipitation in the wintertime comes as snow. 

### Plots 4 and 5: Record High Temperature by Year
The height of the bars represent the number of record high temperature days in a given year. Plot 4 is sorted by year.

Plot 5 is sorted by number of days with record highs.

I wanted to see if there was any inication that more recent years have more record high temperature days, which could indicate climate change. The first graph does not seem to have this trend. The second graph makes it easy to see which years had the most record high temperature days.
